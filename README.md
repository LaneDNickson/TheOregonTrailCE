# The Oregon Trail CE

Hello Everyone!

Thank you for downloading The Oregon Trail for the TI-84 Plus CE, a recreation of the 
original for MS-DOS (I highly recommend playing the original). I've spent many months working 
on this project, as it is my first program ever made using the ICE language. I've done some 
mild bugtesting, but if you do find any along the trail, please notify me so I can hopefully
fix them. I hope you enjoy the game and learn  how hard it is to survive along the trail! 
Feel free to view and edit the source code too (just make sure to follow the terms of the
creative commons license)!

Enjoy!
